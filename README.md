**Proposed Environments**
I would propose to have three environments namely:
- Dev - normal development work, bug fixes, is done and deployed here
- Pre-Prod - whatever have been developed and deployed and passed,is further tested to ensure sanity,e.g the app can be exposed to a large database like the one in production to see the performance.
- Prod - This is the main Production where applications run.
